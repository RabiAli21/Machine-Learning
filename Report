Gene Causality Analysis using Phenotype-Gene Embeddings

1. Introduction

The objective of this exercise is to explore if the embeddings of phenotypes and their corresponding genes can indicate gene causality. Given embeddings for a set of phenotypes and genes, our goal is to analyze these embeddings for patterns that separate causal gene-phenotype pairs from non-causal ones.

2. Data Preparation

We began with the following files as specified:

opentargets_step2.for_llm.tsv: Contains phenotypes and associated genes.
gene_embeddings.csv and phenotype_embeddings.csv: 3072-dimensional embeddings for each gene and phenotype.
opentargets_step2.labels: Indicates the causal gene for each phenotype.
To ensure a unique subset, we hashed our name to generate a random seed, using it to sample 500 phenotypes. This approach guarantees reproducibility while providing a personalized dataset.

3. Methodology

Data Integration and Labeling:

Merged phenotype and gene embeddings using unique identifiers.
Labeled each phenotype-gene pair as "causal" or "non-causal" based on the causal gene identified in opentargets_step2.labels.

Dimensionality Reduction (PCA):

Since analyzing the raw 3072-dimensional embeddings is computationally intensive and difficult to visualize, we applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the embeddings to 2 dimensions.
The reduced data was visualized to check if causal and non-causal pairs show any discernible patterns.

Clustering (K-means):

We applied K-means clustering with two clusters (assuming potential separation of causal and non-causal pairs).
By overlaying the cluster assignments on the reduced PCA space, we analyzed if clustering can distinguish between causal and non-causal embeddings.

4. Results

PCA Visualization:
The scatter plot of PCA-reduced embeddings showed some grouping patterns, though clear separation of causal from non-causal pairs was not immediately apparent
.
Clustering Analysis:
K-means clustering did produce distinct clusters; however, the overlap with causal and non-causal labels was partial.
The cluster-label cross-tabulation indicated that while some causal pairs grouped together, the distinction was not absolute, suggesting that additional features or methods may be needed to fully capture causality signals.

5. Conclusion and Future Work
This exploratory analysis demonstrated that phenotype-gene embeddings contain some inherent patterns, though separating causal and non-causal relationships may require more complex modeling or additional embeddings manipulation. Future steps could involve advanced dimensionality reduction techniques, like t-SNE or UMAP, or supervised methods if labeled data becomes available. Additionally, further exploration of vector manipulations or neural embeddings might enhance causality detection.
